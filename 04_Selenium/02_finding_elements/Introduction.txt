Finding Element

There are several strategies to find an element in a webpage:
- driver.find_element_by_id()
- driver.find_element_by_name()
- driver.find_element_by_xpath()
- driver.find_element_by_css_selector()
- driver.find_element_by_link_text()
- driver.find_element_by_partial_link_text()
- driver.find_element_by_class_name()
- driver.find_element_by_tag_name()

Apart from the public methods given above, there are two private methods which might be useful with locators in page objects.
These are the two private methods: find_element and find_elements.

driver.find_element(by, value)
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//button')

These are the attributes available for By class:

ID = "id"
XPATH = "xpath"
LINK_TEXT = "link text"
PARTIAL_LINK_TEXT = "partial link text"
NAME = "name"
TAG_NAME = "tag name"
CLASS_NAME = "class name"
CSS_SELECTOR = "css selector"


Finding Elements

Similar to find only one element but returning a list with all the elements matching the expression:

- driver.find_elements_by_name()
- driver.find_elements_by_xpath()
- driver.find_elements_by_css_selector()
- driver.find_elements_by_link_text()
- driver.find_elements_by_partial_link_text()
- driver.find_elements_by_class_name()
- driver.find_elements_by_tag_name()

driver.find_elements(by, value)
driver.find_elements(By.XPATH, '//button')

These are the attributes available for By class:

XPATH = "xpath"
LINK_TEXT = "link text"
PARTIAL_LINK_TEXT = "partial link text"
NAME = "name"
TAG_NAME = "tag name"
CLASS_NAME = "class name"
CSS_SELECTOR = "css selector"
